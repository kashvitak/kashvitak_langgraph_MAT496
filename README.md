MODULE 1:

notebook 1-
simple_Graph:

I tells us the baiscs about graphs, it shows us how to implement the simplest graph, which has a normal edge and a conditional edge.
it tells us about state and node.
state is basically a dictionary with one key which is the graph state
and, node is what takes the value of the state and overrites the value of the graph state.
the normal edge is an edge that is implemented in every possibilites, but a conditional edge is implemented according to the probabilities and the condiditions specified.
